# anagram-java
An **anagram** is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)).

**Note:** Anagrams are case insensitive

Fix the endpoint to return the correct message using "is an anagram of" if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return using "is not an anagram of" otherwise.

### Examples
`"foefet"` is an anagram of `"toffee"`

`"Buckethead"` is an anagram of `"DeathCubeK"`

### Instructions
- You are encouraged to try writing tests. Your solution will be run against many tests after this assessment.
- Push your changes to the `main` branch: `git push origin main`
